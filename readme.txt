------------------------------------ CODE EXECUTION -----------------------------------

- For successful execution of the code, the following libraries should be installed in addition to all the statistical libraries:

  1. YAKE (https://github.com/LIAAD/yake)
  2. RAKE (https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/)
  3. KeyBert (https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT)
  4. PositionRank (https://pypi.org/project/pytextrank/)
  5. Scikit-learn for LDA and TF-IDF (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)



- All the files should be executed in the following manner;

  - Index 1 : HULTH2003 dataset; Index 2 : SemEval2017 dataset; Index 3 : WWW dataset
  - Run the 1.1.---- next 1.2.------ next 1.3.----- and 1.4. ---
  - Similarly for the 2 and 3 indexed files.
