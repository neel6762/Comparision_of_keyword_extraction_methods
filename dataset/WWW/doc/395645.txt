KnowledgeTree : a distributed architecture for adaptive e-learning This paper presents KnowledgeTree , an architecture for adaptive E-Learning based on distributed reusable intelligent learning activities . The goal of KnowledgeTree is to bridge the gap between the currently popular approach to Web-based education , which is centered on learning management systems vs. the powerful but underused technologies in intelligent tutoring and adaptive hypermedia . This integrative architecture attempts to address both the component-based assembly of adaptive systems and teacher-level reusability .
