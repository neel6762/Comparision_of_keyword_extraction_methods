Compositional knowledge management for medical services on semantic web The vision of the Semantic Web is to reduce manual discovery and usage of Web resources ( documents and services ) and to allow software agents to automatically identify these Web resources , integrate them and execute them for achieving the intended goals of the user . Such a composed Web service may be represented as a workflow , called service flow . Current Web service standards are not sufficient for automatic composition . This paper presents different types of compositional knowledge required for Web service discovery and composition . As a proof of concept , we have implemented our framework in a cardiovascular domain which requires advanced service discovery and composition across heterogeneous platforms of multiple organizations .
