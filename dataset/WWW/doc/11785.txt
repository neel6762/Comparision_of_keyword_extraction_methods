Using context - and content-based trust policies on the semantic web The current discussion about a future Semantic Web trust architecture is focused on reputational trust mechanisms based on explicit trust ratings . What is often overlooked is the fact that , besides of ratings , huge parts of the application-specific data published on the Semantic Web are also trust relevant and therefore can be used for flexible , fine-grained trust evaluations . In this poster we propose the usage of context - and content-based trust mechanisms and outline a trust architecture which allows the formulation of subjective and task-specific trust policies as a combination of reputation - , context - and content-based trust mechanisms .
