Web data integration using approximate string join Web data integration is an important preprocessing step for web mining . It is highly likely that several records on the web whose textual representations differ may represent the same real world entity . These records are called approximate duplicates . Data integration seeks to identify such approximate duplicates and merge them into integrated records . Many existing data integration algorithms make use of approximate string join , which seeks to ( approximately ) find all pairs of strings whose distances are less than a certain threshold . In this paper , we propose a new mapping method to detect pairs of strings with similarity above a certain threshold . In our method , each string is first mapped to a point in a high dimensional grid space , then pairs of points whose distances are 1 are identified . We implement it using Oracle SQL and PL\/SQL . Finally , we evaluate this method using real data sets . Experimental results suggest that our method is both accurate and efficient .
