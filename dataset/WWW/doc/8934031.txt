Gossip based streaming In this paper , we propose a novel multicast streaming protocol foroverlay networks , called Gossip Based Streaming ( GBS ) . In GBS , streaming contents are not come from a single upstream source , but delivered from several sources to a client . Though being similarto existing gossip protocols , the unique requirements forstreaming , such as continuous playback , are addressed in our design . Preliminary results show that GBS performs much better indynamic user environments .
