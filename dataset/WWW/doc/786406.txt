Copyright protection on the web : a hybrid digital video watermarking scheme Video is one of the most popular data shared in the Web , and the protection of video copyright is of vast interest . In this paper , we present a comprehensive approach for protecting and managing video copyrights in the Internet with watermarking techniques . We propose a novel hybrid digital video watermarking scheme with scrambled watermarks and error correction codes . The effectiveness of this scheme is verified through a series of experiments , and the robustness of our approach is demonstrated using the criteria of the latest StirMark test .
