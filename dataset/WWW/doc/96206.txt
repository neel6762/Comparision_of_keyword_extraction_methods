Visualising student tracking data to support instructors in web-based distance education This paper presents a novel approach of using web log data generated by course management systems ( CMS ) to help instructors become aware of what is happening in distance learning classes . Specifically , techniques from Information Visualization are used to graphically render complex , multidimensional student tracking data collected by CMS . A system , called CourseVis , illustrates the proposed approach . Graphical representations from the use of CourseVis to visualise data from a java on-line distance course ran with WebCT are presented . Findings from the evaluation of CourseVis are presented , and it is argued that CourseVis can help teachers become aware of some social , behavioural , and cognitive aspects related to distance learners . Using graphical representations of student tracking data , instructors can identify tendencies in their classes , or quickly discover individuals that need special attention .
