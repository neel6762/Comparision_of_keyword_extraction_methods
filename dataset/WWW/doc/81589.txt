An efficient and systematic method to generate xslt stylesheets for different wireless pervasive devices It is a tedious and cumbersome process to update directly a WML document for the wireless Web because its content composes of both data and presentation . Thus , XML is used to handle the data while its XSLT stylesheet is used to extract and format the data for presentation . However , different stylesheets have to be used for different devices . An efficient and systematic method based on the idea of generating two separate sets of rules corresponding to content extracting and formatting parts of the stylesheet is described in this paper . The data extraction part is constructed from content rules while the formatting part is constructed from presentation rules . They are then combined together to form a stylesheet by an XSLT generator . A large number of stylesheets corresponding to different devices and a number of standard DTD documents or XML schemas can be generated in this way and stored in the pool during application setup stage . They will be individually selected from the pool by an XSLT engine to produce different WML documents for different devices during run time .
