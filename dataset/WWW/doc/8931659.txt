A diagrammatic inference system for the web We developed a diagrammatic inference system for the World Wide Web . Our system enables the creation of diagrams such that the information contained in them can be searched and inference can be performed on it . We developed an XMLSchema for bar , line , and pie charts . Based on it , we developed software that transforms a corresponding XML file into an SVG image , which in turn is rendered by the client as an image . Additionally , we developed a search engine which enables a user to find information explicitly contained in the XML file , and as such in the image . Furthermore , we developed an inference engine which enables a user to locate information that is implicitly contained in the image .
