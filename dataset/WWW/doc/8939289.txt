Constraint SVG We believe it is important for web graphic standards such as SVG to support user interaction and diagrams that can adapt their layout and appearance to their viewing context so as to take into account viewing device charateristics and the viewer 's requirements . Previously we suggested that adding expression-based attributes to SVG and using one-way constraints to evaluate these dynamically would considerably improve SVG 's support for adaptive layout and user interaction . We describe a minimal backward compatible extension to SVG 1.1 , called Constraint SVG ( CSVG ) , that provides such expression-based attributes and its implementation on top of Batik . CSVG also provides another significant extension to SVG 1.1 : it allows the author to define new custom elements using XSLT .
