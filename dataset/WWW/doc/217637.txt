Personalization in distributed e-learning environments Personalized support for learners becomes even more important , when e-Learning takes place in open and dynamic learning and information networks . This paper shows how to realize personalized learning support in distributed learning environments based on Semantic Web technologies . Our approach fills the existing gap between current adaptive educational systems with well-established personalization functionality , and open , dynamic learning repository networks . We propose a service-based architecture for establishing personalized e-Learning , where personalization functionality is provided by various web-services . A Personal Learning Assistant integrates personalization services and other supporting services , and provides the personalized access to learning resources in an e-Learning network .
