XJ : integration of XML processing into java The increased importance of XML as a universal data representation format has led to several proposals for enabling the development of applications that operate on XML data . These proposals range from runtime API-based interfaces to XML-based programming languages . The subject of this paper is XJ , a research language that proposes novel mechanisms for the integration of XML as a first-class construct into JavaTM . The design goals of XJ distinguish it from pastwork on integrating XML support into programming languages -- specifically , the XJ design adheres to the XML Schema and XPathstandards , and supports in-place updates of XML data thereby keeping with the imperative nature of Java . We have also built a prototype compiler for XJ , and our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the performance of XJ programs can approach that of tradition allow level API-based interfaces , while providing a higher level of abstraction .
