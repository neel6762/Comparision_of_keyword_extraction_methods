Dynamic assembly of learning objects This paper describes one solution to the problem of how to select sequence , and link Web resources into a coherent , focused organization for instruction that addresses a user 's immediate and focused learning need . A system is described that automatically generates individualized learning paths from a repository of XML Web resources . Each Web resource has an XML Learning Object Metadata ( LOM ) description consisting of General , Educational , and Classification metadata . Dynamic assembly of these learning objects is based on the relative match of the learning object content and metadata to the learner 's needs , preferences , context , and constraints . Learning objects are connected into coherent paths based on their LOM topic classifications and the proximity of these topics in a Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) graph . An instructional sequencing policy specifies how to arrange the objects on the path into a particular learning sequence . The system has been deployed and evaluated within a corporate setting .
