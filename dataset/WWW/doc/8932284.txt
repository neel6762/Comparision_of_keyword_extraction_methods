SLA based profit optimization in web systems With the rapid growth of eBusiness , the Web services are becoming a commodity . To reduce the management cost for the IT infrastructure , companies often outsource their IT services to third party service providers . Large service centers have been setup to provide services to many customers by sharing the IT resources . This leads to the efficient use of resources and a reduction of the operating cost . The service provider and their customers often negotiate utility based Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) to determine the cost and penalty based on the achieved performance level . The system is based on a centralized controller which can control the request volumes at various servers and the scheduling policy at each server . The controller can also decide to turn ON or OFF servers depending on the system load . This paper designs a resource allocation scheduler for such web environments so as to maximize the profits associated with multiple class SLAs .
