A semantic approach for designing business protocols Business processes involve interactions among autonomous partners . We propose that these interactions be specified modularly as protocols . Protocols can be published , enabling implementors to independently develop components that respect published protocols and yet serve diverse interests . A variety of business protocols would be needed to capture subtle business needs . We propose that the same kinds of conceptual abstractions be developed for protocols as for information models . Specifically , we consider ( 1 ) refinement : a subprotocol may satisfy the requirements of a superprotocol , but support additional properties and ( 2 ) aggregation : a protocol may combine existing protocols . In support of the above , we develop a formal semantics for protocols , an operational characterization of them , and an algebra for protocol composition .
