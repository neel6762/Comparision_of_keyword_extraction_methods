Towards a flash search engine based on expressive semantics Flash , as a multimedia format , becomes more and more popular on the Web . However , previous works on Flash are totally based on low-level features , which make it unpractical to build a content-based Flash search engine . To address this problem , our paper proposes expressive semantics for bridging the gap between low-level features and user queries . To smoothly incorporate expressive semantics into a search engine , an eigenvector-based model is devised to map a user query to expressive semantics with the aid of link analysis method . Our experiment results confirm that expressive semantics is a promising approach to understanding and hence searching Flash movies more efficiently .
