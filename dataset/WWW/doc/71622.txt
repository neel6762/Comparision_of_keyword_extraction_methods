Delivering web service coordination capability to users As web service technology matures there is growing interest in exploiting workflow techniques to coordinate web services . Bioinformaticians are a user community who combine web resources to perform in silico experiments . These users are scientists and not information technology experts they require workflow solutions that have a low cost of entry for service users and providers . Problems satisfying these requirements with current techniques led to the development of the Simple conceptual unified flow language ( Scufl ) . Scufl is supported by the Freefluo enactment engine ( 1 ) , and the Taverna editing workbench ( 3 ) . The extensibility of Scufl , supported by these tools , means that workflows coordinating web services can be matched to how users view their problems . The Taverna workbench exploits the web to keep Scufl simple by retrieving detail from URIs when required , and by scavenging the web for services . Scufl and its tools are not bioinformatics specific . They can be exploited by other communities who require user-driven composition and execution of workflows coordinating web resources .
