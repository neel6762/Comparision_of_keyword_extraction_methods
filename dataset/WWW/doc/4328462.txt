The credibility of the posted information in a recommendation system based on a map We propose a method for estimating the credibility of the posted information from users . The system displays these information on the map . Since posted information can include subjective information from various perspectives , we ca n't trust all of the postings as they are . We propose and integrate factors of the user 's geographic posting tendency and votes by other users .
