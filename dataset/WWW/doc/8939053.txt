Time-based contextualized-news browser ( t-cnb ) We propose a new way of browsing contextualized-news articles . Our prototype browser system is called a Time-based Contextualized-News Browser ( T-CNB ) . The T-CNB concurrently and automatically presents a series of related pages for one news source while browsing the user-specified page . It extracts the past related pages from a user-specified news articles on the web . The related pages outline the progress of user-specified news articles . We call the related pages ` contextual pages ' . Using the T-CNB , a user only needs to specify one news article on the web . The user then automatically receives past related news articles , which provide a wider understanding of the topic . The T-CNB automatically generates and presents contextualized news articles .
