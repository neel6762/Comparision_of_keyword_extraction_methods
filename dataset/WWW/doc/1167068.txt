Semantic virtual environments Today 's Virtual Environment ( VE ) systems share a number of issues with the HTML-based World Wide Web . Their content is usually designed for presentation to humans , and thus is not suitable for machine access . This is complicated by the large number of different data models and network protocols in use . Accordingly , it is difficult to develop VE software , such as agents , services , and tools . In this paper we adopt the Semantic Web idea to the field of virtual environments . Using the Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) we establish a machine-understandable abstraction of existing VE systems -- the Semantic Virtual Environments ( SVE ) . On this basis it is possible to develop system-independent software , which could even operate across VE system boundaries .
