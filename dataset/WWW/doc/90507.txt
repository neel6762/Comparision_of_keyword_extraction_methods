Hybrid multicasting in large-scale service networks The importance of service composition has been widely recognized in the Internet research community due to its high flexibility in allowing development of customized applications . So far little attention has been paid to composite services ' runtime performance-related aspects , which are of great importance to wide-area applications . Service composition in the wide area actually creates a new type of routing problem which we call QoS service routing . We study this problem in large networks ( e.g. , the Web ) and provide distributed and scalable routing solutions with various optimization goals . Most importantly , we propose ways to reduce redundancies of data delivery and service execution through explorations of different types of multicast ( service multicast and data multicast ) in one-to-many application scenarios .
