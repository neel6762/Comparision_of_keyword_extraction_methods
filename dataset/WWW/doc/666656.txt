The web around the corner : augmenting the browser with gps As programmable mobile devices ( such as high-end cellular phones and Personal Digital Assistants ) became widely adopted , users ask for Internet access on-the-road . While upcoming technologies like UMTS and Wi-Fi provide broadband wireless communication , Web services and Web browsers do not provide any sort of location-awareness yet . As GPS receivers get cheaper , positioning devices will be embedded into commercial mobile devices . Thus , the position of the user can be used to filter and tailor the information presented to the user as already done for language preferences and user-agent . This paper describes early results of an ongoing project called GPSWeb , which aims to provide GPS support for Web browsers and an application model for Location-Based Services . It introduces the Location-Based Browsing concept that enhances the classic Webuser-Website interaction .
