Interpreting distributed ontologies Semantic Web is challenged by the URI meaning issues arising from putting ontologies in open and distributed environments . As a try to clarify some of the meaning issues , this paper proposes a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies , it 's built on the top of local models semantics , and extends it to deal with the URI sharing by harmonizing the local models via agreement on vocabulary provenance . The commitment relationship is presented to allow the URI sharing between ontologies with richer semantics .
