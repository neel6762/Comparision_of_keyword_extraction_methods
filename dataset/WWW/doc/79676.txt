A web services architecture for learning object discovery and assembly Courseware systems are often based on an assembly of different components , addressing the different needs of storage and delivery functionality . The Learning Technology Standard Architecture LTSA provides a generic architectural framework for these systems . Recent developments in Web technology -- e.g. the Web services framework -- have greatly enhanced the flexible and interoperable implementation of courseware architectures . We argue that in order to make the Web services philosophy work , two enhancements to the LTSA approach are required . Firstly , a combination with metadata annotation is needed to support the discovery of educational Web services . Secondly , if these components are to be provided in form of services , more support is needed for their assembly . Architectural patterns of a finer degree of granularity shall satisfy this need .
