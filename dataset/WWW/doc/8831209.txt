SEMPL : a semantic portal Semantic Web technology is intended for the retrieval , collection , and analysis of meaningful data with significant automation afforded by machine understandability of data ( 1 ) . As one illustration of semantic web technology in action , we present SEMPL , a semantic web portal for the Large Scale Distributed Information Systems lab ( LSDIS ) at the University of Georgia . SEMPL , which is powered by a state of the art commercial system , Semagix Freedom ( 7 ) , uses an ontology-driven approach to provide semantic browsing , linking , and contextual querying of content within the portal . By using the ontology based information integration technique , SEMPL can specify the context of a particular piece of research information , annotate web pages , and provide links to semantically related areas enabling a rich contextual retrieval of information .
