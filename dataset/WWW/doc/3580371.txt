Semantic web applications to e-science in silico experiments This paper explains our research and implementations of manual , automatic and deep annotations of provenance logs for e-Science insilico experiments . Compared to annotating general Web documents , annotations for scientific data require more sophisticated professional knowledge to recognize concepts from documents , and more complex text extraction and mapping mechanisms . A simple automatic annotation approach based on `` lexicons '' and a deep annotation implemented by semantically populating , translating and annotating provenance logs are introduced in this paper . We used COHSE ( Conceptual Open Hypermedia Services Environment ) to annotate and browse provenance logs from my Grid project , which are conceptually linked together as a hypertext Web of provenance logs and experiment resources , based on the associated conceptual metadata and reasoning over these metadata .
