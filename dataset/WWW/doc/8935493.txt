Testbed for information extraction from deep web Search results generated by searchable databases are served dynamically and far larger than the static documents on the Web . These results pages have been referred to as the Deep Web . We need to extract the target data in results pages to integrate them on different searchable databases . We propose a test bed for information extraction from search results . We chose 100 databases randomly from 114,540 pages with search forms . Therefore , these databases have a good variety . We selected 51 databases which include URLs in a results pageand manually identify target information to be extracted . We also suggest evaluation measures for comparing extraction methods and methods for extending the target data .
