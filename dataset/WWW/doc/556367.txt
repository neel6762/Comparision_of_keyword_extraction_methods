Meaning and the semantic web The meaning of names ( URI references ) is a contentious issue in the Semantic Web . Numerous proposals have been given for how to provide meaning for names in the Semantic Web , ranging from a strict localized model-theoretic semantics to proposals for a unified single meaning . We argue that a slight expansion of the standard model-theoretic semantics for names is sufficient for the present , and can easily be augmented where necessary to allow communities of interest to strengthen this spartan theory of meaning .
