Towards context-aware adaptable web services In this paper , we present a context framework that facilitates the development and deployment of context-aware adaptable Web services . Web services are provided with context information about clients that may be utilized to provide a personalized behavior . Context is extensible with new types of information at any time without any changes to the underlying infrastructure . Context processing is done by Web services , context plugins , or context services . Context plugins and context services pre - and post-process Web service messages based on the available contextinformation . Both are essential for automatic context processing and automatic adaption of Web services to new context types without the necessity to adjust the Web services themselves . We implemented the context framework within the ServiceGlobe system , our open and distributed Web service platform .
