A scheme of service discovery and control on ubiquitous devices We have developed a set of hardware and software components to realize ubiquitous computing environments , based on two keywords , simple '' ( easy to implement ) and `` open '' ( adopt widely publicized specifications ) . Then this set has been resulted into UBKit ( Ubiquity Building Toolkit ) . The Micro-Server an instance of UBKitenables existing consumer electronics to join in computer networks . In this paperwe propose a scheme for discovery and control of deviecs attached to micro-servers . ''
