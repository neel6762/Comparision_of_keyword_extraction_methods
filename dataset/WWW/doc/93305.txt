Model based engineering of learning situations for adaptive web based educational systems In this paper , we propose an approach for the engineering of web based educational applications . The applications that we focus require advanced functionality for regulating and tutoring learners ' activities ( dynamics of learning ) . Our approach aims at proposing models , not only to describe details of such learning situations , but also to characterize the constraints that the Learning Management System exploiting such situations must satisfy in this sense , this approach also contributes to the specification of the Adaptive Web Based Educational System ( AWBES ) fitted to a particular learning situation . Moreover , this approach for the engineering of learning situations conforms to current software engineering research works .
