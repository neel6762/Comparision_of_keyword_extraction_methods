XL : an XML programming language for web service specification and composition We present an XML programming language specially designed for the implementation of Web services . XL is portable and fully compliant with W3C standards such as XQuery , XML Protocol , and XML Schema . One of the key features of XL is that it allows programmers to concentrate on the logic of their application . XL provides high-level and declarative constructs for actions which are typically carried out in the implementation of a Web service ; e.g. , logging , error handling , retry of actions , workload management , events , etc. . Issues such as performance tuning ( e.g. , caching , horizontal partitioning , etc. ) should be carried out automatically by an implementation of the language . This way , the productivity of the programmers , the ability of evolution of the programs , and the chances to achieve good performance are substantially enhanced .
