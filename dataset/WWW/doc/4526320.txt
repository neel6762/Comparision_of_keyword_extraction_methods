SLL : running my web services on your WS platforms Today , the choice for a particular programming language limits the alternative products that can be used to deploy the program . For instance , a Java program must be executed using a Java VM . This limitation is particularly harmful for the emergence of a new programming paradigm like SOA and Web Services because platforms for new innovative programming languages are typically not as stable and mature as the established platforms for traditional programming paradigms . The purpose of this work is to break the strong ties between programming languages and runtime environments and thus make it possible to innovate at both ends independently . Thereby , the specific focus is on Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures ; focusing on this domain makes it possible to achieve this goal with affordable efforts . The key idea is to introduce a Service Language Layer ( SLL ) which gives a high-level abstraction of a service-oriented program and which can easily and efficiently be executed on alternative Web Services platforms .
