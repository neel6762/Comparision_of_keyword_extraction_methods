Distributed location aware web crawling Distributed crawling has shown that it can overcome important limitations of the today 's crawling paradigm . However , the optimal benefits of this approach are usually limited to the sites hosting the crawler . In this work , we propose a location-aware method , called IPMicra , that utilizes an IP address hierarchy , and allows crawling of links in a near optimal location aware manner .
