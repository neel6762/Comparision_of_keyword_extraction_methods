Mining RDF metadata for generalized association rules : knowledge discovery in the semantic web era In this paper , we present a novel frequent generalized pattern mining algorithm , called GP-Close , for mining generalized associations from RDF metadata . To solve the over-generalization problem encountered by existing methods , GP-Close employs the notion of emphgeneralization closure for systematic over-generalization reduction .
