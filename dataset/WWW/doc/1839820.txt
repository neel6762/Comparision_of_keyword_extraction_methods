TCOZ approach to semantic web services design Complex Semantic Web ( SW ) services may have intricate data state , autonomous process behavior and concurrent interactions . The design of such SW service systems requires precise and powerful modelling techniques to capture not only the ontology domain properties but also the services ' process behavior and functionalities . In this paper we apply an integrated formal modeling language , Timed Communicating Object Z ( TCOZ ) , to design SW services . Furthermore , the paper presents the development of the systematic translation rules and tools which can automatically extract the SW ontology and services semantic markup from the formal TCOZ design model .
