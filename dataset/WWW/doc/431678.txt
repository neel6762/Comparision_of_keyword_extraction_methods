Clarifying the fundamentals of HTTP The simplicity of HTTP was a major factor in the success of the Web . However , as both the protocol and its uses have evolved , HTTP has grown complex . This complexity results in numerous problems , including confused implementors , interoperability failures , difficulty in extending the protocol , and a long specification without much documented rationale . Many of the problems with HTTP can be traced to unfortunate choices about fundamental definitions and models . This paper analyzes the current ( HTTP\/1 .1 ) protocol design , showing how it fails in certain cases , and how to improve these fundamentals . Some problems with HTTP can be fixed simply by adopting new models and terminology , allowing us to think more clearly about implementations and extensions . Other problems require explicit ( but compatible ) protocol changes .
