SmartInt : using mined attribute dependencies to integrate fragmented web databases Many web databases can be seen as providing partial and overlapping information about entities in the world . To answer queries effectively , we need to integrate the information about the individual entities that are fragmented over multiple sources . At first blush this is just the inverse of traditional database normalization problem - rather than go from a universal relation to normalized tables , we want to reconstruct the universal relation given the tables ( sources ) . The standard way of reconstructing the entities will involve joining the tables . Unfortunately , because of the autonomous and decentralized way in which the sources are populated , they often do not have Primary Key - Foreign Key relations . While tables do share attributes , direct joins over these shared attributes can result in reconstruction of many spurious entities thus seriously compromising precision . We present a unified approach that supports intelligent retrieval over fragmented web databases by mining and using inter-table dependencies . Experiments with the prototype implementation , SmartInt , show that its retrieval strikes a good balance between precision and recall .
