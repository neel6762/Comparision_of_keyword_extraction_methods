A quality model for multichannel adaptive information The ongoing diffusion of novel and mobile devices offers new ways to provide services across a growing set of network technologies . As a consequence , traditional information systems evolve to multichannel systems in which services are provided through different channels , being a channel the abstraction of a device and a network . This work proposes a quality model suitable for capturing and reasoning about quality aspects of multichannel information systems . In particular , the model enables a clear separation of modeling aspects of services , networks , and devices . Further , it embeds rules enabling the evaluation of end-to-end quality , which can be used to select services according to the actual quality perceived by users .
