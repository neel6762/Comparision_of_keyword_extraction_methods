Rapid prototyping of web applications combining domain specific languages and model driven design There have been several authoring methods proposed in the literature that are model based , essentially following the Model Driven Design philosophy . While useful , such methods need an effective way to allow the application designer to somehow synthesize the actual running application from the specification . In this paper , we describe HyperDE , an environment that combines Model Driven Design and Domain Specific Languages to enable rapid prototyping of Web applications .
