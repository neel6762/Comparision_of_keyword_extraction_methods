On the temporal dimension of search Web search is probably the single most important application on the Internet . The most famous search techniques are perhaps the PageRank and HITS algorithms . These algorithms are motivated by the observation that a hyperlink from a page to another is an implicit conveyance of authority to the target page . They exploit this social phenomenon to identify quality pages , e.g. , `` authority '' pages and `` hub '' pages . In this paper we argue that these algorithms miss an important dimension of the Web , the temporal dimension . The Web is not a static environment . It changes constantly . Quality pages in the past may not be quality pages now or in the future . These techniques favor older pages because these pages have many in-links accumulated over time . New pages , which may be of high quality , have few or no in-links and are left behind . Bringing new and quality pages to users is important because most users want the latest information . Research publication search has exactly the same problem . This paper studies the temporal dimension of search in the context of research publication search . We propose a number of methods deal with the problem . Our experimental results show that these methods are highly effective .
