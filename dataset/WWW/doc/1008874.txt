Small world peer networks in distributed web search In ongoing research , a collaborative peer network application is being proposed to address the scalability limitations of centralized search engines . Here we introduce a local adaptive routing algorithm used to dynamically change the topology of the peer network based on a simple learning scheme driven by query response interactions among neighbors . We test the algorithm via simulations with 70 model users based on actual Web crawls . We find that the network topology rapidly converges from a random network to a small world network , with emerging clusters that match the user communities with shared interests .
