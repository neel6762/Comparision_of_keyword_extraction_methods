QoS computation and policing in dynamic web service selection The emerging Service-Oriented Computing ( SOC ) paradigm promises to enable businesses and organizations to collaborate in an unprecedented way by means of standard web services . To support rapid and dynamic composition of services in this paradigm , web services that meet requesters ' functional requirements must be able to be located and bounded dynamically from a large and constantly changing number of service providers based on their Quality of Service ( QoS ) . In order to enable quality-driven web service selection , we need an open , fair , dynamic and secure framework to evaluate the QoS of a vast number of web services . The fair computation and enforcing of QoS of web services should have minimal overhead but yet able to achieve sufficient trust by both service requesters and providers . In this paper , we presented our open , fair and dynamic QoS computation model for web services selection through implementation of and experimentation with a QoS registry in a hypothetical phone service provisioning market place application .
