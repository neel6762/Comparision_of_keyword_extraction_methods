An abuse-free fair contract signing protocol based on the RSA signature A fair contract signing protocol allows two potentially mistrusted parities to exchange their commitments ( i.e. , digital signatures ) to an agreed contract over the Internet in a fair way , so that either each of them obtains the other 's signature , or neither party does . Based on the RSA signature scheme , a new digital contract signing protocol is proposed in this paper . Like the existing RSA-based solutions for the same problem , our protocol is not only fair , but also optimistic , since the third trusted party is involved only in the situations where one party is cheating or the communication channel is interrupted . Furthermore , the proposed protocol satisfies a new property , i.e. , it is abuse-free . That is , if the protocol is executed unsuccessfully , none of the two parties can show the validity of intermediate results to others . Technical details are provided to analyze the security and performance of the proposed protocol . In summary , we present the first abuse-free fair contract signing protocol based on the RSA signature , and show that it is both secure and efficient .
