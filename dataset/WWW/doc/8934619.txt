An application server for the semantic web The Semantic Web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies . Therefore , sophisticated Semantic Web applications typically comprise more than one software module . Instead of coming up with proprietary solutions , developers should be able to rely on a generic infrastructure for application development in this context . We call such an infrastructure Application Server for the Semantic Web whose design and development are based on existing Application Servers . However , we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the Semantic Web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself . We provide a short overview of requirements and design issues of such a server and present our implementation and ongoing work KAON SERVER .
