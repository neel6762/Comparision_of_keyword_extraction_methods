Reactive rules inference from dynamic dependency models Defining dependency models is sometimes an easier , more intuitive way for ontology representation than defining reactive rules directly , as it provides a higher level of abstraction . We will shortly introduce the ADI ( Active Dependency Integration ) model capabilities , emphasizing new developments : 1 . Support of automatic dependencies instantiation from an abstract definition that expresses a general dependency in the ontology , namely a `` template '' . 2 . Inference of rules for dynamic dependency models where dependencies and entities may be inserted deleted and updated . We use the eTrade example in order to exemplify those capabilities .
