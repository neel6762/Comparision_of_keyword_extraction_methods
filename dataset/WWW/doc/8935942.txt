On a web browsing support system with 3d visualization Existing commercial Web browsers provide various utilities and functions , e.g. , Web bookmarks and a browsing history list . Since the bookmark and history functions only the title and URL of the Web page , users who can not remember the contents of each Web page have difficulty retracing their steps . In this paper , we propose a bookmark system based on a 3D interface . Additionally , our system offers three main functions a 3D browsing history function , a marker function , and a look-ahead loading function . These functions enable users to browse Web pages more effectively .
