Scheduling web requests in broadcast environments On-demand broadcast has been supported in the Internet to enhance system scalability . Unfortunately , most of existing on-demand scheduling algorithms did not consider the time constraints associated with web requests . This paper proposes a novel scheduling algorithm , called Slack Inverse Number of requests ( SIN ) , that takes into account the urgency and productivity of serving pending requests . Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that SIN significantly out performs existing algorithms over a wide range of workloads .
