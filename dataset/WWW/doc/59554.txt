Authoring of learning styles in adaptive hypermedia : problems and solutions Learning styles , as well as the best ways of responding with corresponding instructional strategies , have been intensively studied in the classical educational ( classroom ) setting . There is much less research of application of learning styles in the new educational space , created by the Web . Moreover , authoring applications are scarce , and they do not provide explicit choices and creation of instructional strategies for specific learning styles . The main objective of the research described in this paper is to provide the authors with a tool which will allow them to incorporate different learning styles in their adaptive educational hypermedia applications . In this way , we are creating a semantically significant interface between classical learning styles and instructional strategies and the modern field of adaptive educational hypermedia .
