Flexible on-device service object replication with replets An increasingly large amount of Web applications employ service objects such as Servlets to generate dynamic and personalized content . Existing caching infrastructures are not well suited for caching such content in mobile environments because of disconnection and weak connection . One possible approach to this problem is to replicate Web-related application logic to client devices . The challenges to this approach are to deal with client devices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities , to support applications that have different data sharing and coherency requirements , and to accommodate the same application under different deployment environments . The Replet system targets these challenges . It uses client , server and application capability and preference information ( CPI ) to direct the replication of service objects to client devices : from the selection of a device for replication and populating the device with client-specific data , to choosing an appropriate replica to serve a given request and maintaining the desired state consistency among replicas . The Replet system exploits on-device replication to enable client - , server - and application-specific cost metrics for replica invocation and synchronization . We have implemented a prototype in the context of Servlet-based Web applications . Our experiment and simulation results demonstrate the viability and significant benefits of CPI-driven on-device service object replication .
