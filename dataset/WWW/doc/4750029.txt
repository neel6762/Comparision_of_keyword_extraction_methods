The powerrank web link analysis algorithm The web graph follows the power law distribution and has a hierarchy structure . But neither the PageRank algorithm nor any of its improvements leverage these attributes . In this paper , we propose a novel link analysis algorithm `` the PowerRank algorithm '' , which makes use of the power law distribution attribute and the hierarchy structure of the web graph . The algorithm consists two parts . In the first part , special treatment is applied to the web pages with low `` importance '' score . In the second part , the global `` importance '' score for each web page is obtained by combining those scores together . Our experimental results show that : 1 ) The PowerRank algorithm computes 10 % -30 % faster than PageRank algorithm . 2 ) Top web pages in PowerRank algorithm remain similar to that of the PageRank algorithm .
