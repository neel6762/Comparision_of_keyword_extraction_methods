Antourage : mining distance-constrained trips from flickr We study how to automatically extract tourist trips from large volumes of geo-tagged photographs . Working with more than 8 million of these photographs that are publicly available via photo - sharing communities such as Flickr and Panoramio , our goal is to satisfy the needs of a tourist who specifies a starting location ( typically a hotel ) together with a bounded travel distance and demands a tour that visits the popular sites along the way . Our system , named ANTOURAGE , solves this intractable problem using a novel adaptation of the max-min ant system ( MMAS ) meta-heuristic . Experiments using GPS metadata crawled from Flickr show that ANTOURAGE can generate high-quality tours .
