Query-free news search Many daily activities present information in the form of a stream of text , and often people can benefit from additional information on the topic discussed . TV broadcast news can be treated as one such stream of text ; in this paper we discuss finding news articles on the web that are relevant to news currently being broadcast . We evaluated a variety of algorithms for this problem , looking at the impact of inverse document frequency , stemming , compounds , history , and query length on the relevance and coverage of news articles returned in real time during a broadcast . We also evaluated several postprocessing techniques for improving the precision , including reranking using additional terms , reranking by document similarity , and filtering on document similarity . For the best algorithm , 84 % -91 % of the articles found were relevant , with at least 64 % of the articles being on the exact topic of the broadcast . In addition , a relevant article was found for at least 70 % of the topics .
