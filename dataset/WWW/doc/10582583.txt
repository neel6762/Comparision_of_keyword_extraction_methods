What is disputed on the web ? We present a method for automatically acquiring of a corpus of disputed claims from the web . We consider a factual claim to be disputed if a page on the web suggests both that the claim is false and also that other people say it is true . Our tool extracts disputed claims by searching the web for patterns such as `` falsely claimed that X '' and then using a statistical classifier to select text that appears to be making a disputed claim . We argue that such a corpus of disputed claims is useful for a wide range of applications related to information credibility on the web , and we report what our current corpus reveals about what is being disputed on the web .
