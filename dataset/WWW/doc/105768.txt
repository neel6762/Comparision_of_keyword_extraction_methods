Tv2web : generating and browsing web with multiple lod from video streams and their metadata We propose a method of automatically constructing Web content from video streams with metadata that we call TV2Web . The Web content includes thumbnails of video units and caption data generated from metadata . Users can watch TV ona normal Web browser . They can also manipulate Web content with zooming metaphors to seamlessly alter the level of detail ( LOD ) of the content being viewed . They can search for favorite scenes faster than with analog video equipment , and experience a new cross-media environment . We also developed a prototype of the TV2Web system and discuss its implementation .
