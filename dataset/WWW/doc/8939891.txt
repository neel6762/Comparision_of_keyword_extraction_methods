Using semantic web approach in augmented audio reality system for museum visitors In this paper , we describe our work in progress on the reasoning module of ec ( h ) o , an augmented audio-reality interface for museum visitors utilizing spatialized soundscapes and a semantic web approach to information . We used ontologies to describe the semantics of sound objects and represent user model . A rule-based system for selecting sound object uses semantic description of objects , visitor 's interaction history and heuristics for continuity of the dialogue between user and the system .
