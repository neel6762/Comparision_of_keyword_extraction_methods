PodCred : a framework for analyzing podcast preference The PodCred framework is a framework for assessing the credibility and quality of podcasts published on the internet . It consists of a series of indicators designed to support prediction of listener preference of one podcast over another , given that both carry comparable informational content . The indicators are grouped into four categories pertaining to the Podcast Content , the Podcaster , the Podcast Context or the Technical Execution of the podcast . We adopt the term `` cred '' as a designation encompassing both credibility ( comprising trustworthiness and expertise ) and qualitative acceptability to listeners . Our podcast analysis framework is inspired by work on credibility in blogs , another medium dominated by user generated content . The PodCred framework is derived from a review of the literature on credibility for other media , a survey of prescriptive standards for podcasting , and a detailed data analysis of award winning podcasts . The paper concludes with a discussion of future work in which the framework will be applied .
