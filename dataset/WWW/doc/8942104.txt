Best bets : thousands of queries in search of a client A number of applications require selecting targets for specific contents on the basis of criteria defined by the contents providers rather than selecting documents in response to user queries , as in ordinary information retrieval .

We developed techniques for implementing Best Bets systems addressing performance issues for large scale deployment as efficient query search , incremental updates and dynamic ranking .
