An agent system reasoning about the web and the user The paper describes some innovations related to the ongoing work on the GSA prototype , an integrated information retrieval agent . In order to improve the original system effectiveness , we propose the GSA2 system , introducing a new internal architecture based on a message-passing framework and on an ontology description formalism ( WOLF , Web ontology Framework ) . GSA2 is conceived in order to describe and easily perform reasoning on `` facts about the web and the user '' . The most innovative aspect of the project is its customizable and flexible reasoning system , based on Answer Set Programming it plays the role of the central decision making module , and allows the Agent to take proactive decisions . The introduction of a logic language allows one to describe , program and plan behaviors of the Agent easily and quickly , and to experiment with a large variety of Information Retrieval strategies . Both the System Architecture and WOLF are general and reusable , and the result constitutes a good example of real implementation of agents based on logics .
