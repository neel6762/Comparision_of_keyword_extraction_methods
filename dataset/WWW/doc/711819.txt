Distribution of relevant documents in domain-level aggregates for topic distillation In this paper , we study the distribution of relevant documents in aggregates , formed by grouping the retrieved documents according to their domain . For each aggregate , we take into account its size , and a measure of the correlation between its incoming and outgoing hyperlinks . We report on a preliminary experiment with two TREC topic distillation tasks , where we find that larger aggregates , or those aggregates with correlated hyperlinks , are more likely to contain relevant documents . This result shows that the distribution of domain-level aggregates is potentially useful for finding relevant documents .
