Simple authentication for the web Automated email-based password reestablishment ( EBPR ) is an efficient , cost-effective means to deal with forgotten passwords . In this technique , email providers authenticate users on behalf of web sites . This method works because web sites trust email providers to deliver messages to their intended recipients . Simple Authentication for the Web ( SAW ) improves upon this basic approach to user authentication to create an alternative to password-based logins . SAW : 1 ) Removes the setup and management costs of passwords at sites that accept the risks of EBPR ; 2 ) Provides single sign-on without a specialized identity provider ; 3 ) Thwarts all passive attacks .
