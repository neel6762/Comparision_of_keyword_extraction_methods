On measuring the quality of Wikipedia articles This paper discusses an approach to modeling and measuring information quality of Wikipedia articles . The approach is based on the idea that the quality of Wikipedia articles with distinctly different profiles needs to be measured using different information quality models . We report on our initial study , which involved two categories of Wikipedia articles : `` stabilized '' ( those , whose content has not undergone major changes for a significant period of time ) and `` controversial '' ( the articles , which have undergone vandalism , revert wars , or whose content is subject to internal discussions between Wikipedia editors ) . We present simple information quality models and compare their performance on a subset of Wikipedia articles with the information quality evaluations provided by human users . Our experiment shows , that using special-purpose models for information quality captures user sentiment about Wikipedia articles better than using a single model for both categories of articles .
