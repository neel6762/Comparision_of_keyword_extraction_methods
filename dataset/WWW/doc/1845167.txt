Lessons from a Gnutella-web gateway We present a gateway between the WWW and the Gnutella peer-to-peer network that permits searchers on one side to be able to search and retrieve files on the other side of the gateway . This work improvesthe accessibility of files across different delivery platforms , making it possible to use a single search modality . We outline our design and implementation , present access statistics from a test deployment and discuss lessons learned .
