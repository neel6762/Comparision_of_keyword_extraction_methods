Post-processing inkml for random-access navigation of voluminous handwritten ink documents The goal of this research is the improvement of browsing voluminous InkML data in two areas : ease of rendering continuous ink-flow for replay-browsing , and ease of random access navigation in eLearning domains . The notion of real-time random access navigation in ink documents has not yet been fully exploited . Users of existing eLearning browsers are restricted to viewing static annotated slides that are inferior in quality when compared to actively replaying the same slides with sequenced ink-flow of the annotated freehand writings . We are developing a tool to investigate ways of managing massive InkML data for efficient `` active visible scrolling '' of recorded freehand writings in ink documents . This work will also develop and evaluate new post-processing techniques that take advantage of the relationship between ink volumes and active-rendering times for real-time random access navigation .
