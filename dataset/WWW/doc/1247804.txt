RDF triples in XML RDF\/XML does not layer RDF on top of XML ina useful way . We use a simple direct representation of the RDF abstract syntax in XML . We add the ability to name graphs , noting that in practice this is already widely used . We use XSLT as a general syntactic extensibility mechanism to provide human friendly macros for our syntax . This provides a simple serialization solving a persistent problem in the Semantic Web .
