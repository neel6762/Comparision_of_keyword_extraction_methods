Associative sources and agents for zero-input publishing This paper presents an associative agent that allows seamless navigation from one 's own personal space to third-party associative sources , as well as the personal spaces of other users . The agent provides users with access to a dynamically growing list of information sources , all of which follow a common associative sources API that we have defined . The agent also allows users act as sources themselves and take part in peer-to peer knowledge sharing .
