CC-Buddy : an adaptive framework for maintaining cache coherency using peers In this paper , we propose a framework called CC-Buddy , for maintaining dynamic data coherency in peer-to-peer environment . Working on the basis of peer heterogeneity in data coherency requirement , peers in CC-Buddy cooperate with each other to disseminate the updates by pushing . Simulation results show that our solution not only improves the fidelity in data , but also reduces the workload of servers , therefore achieves high-scalability .
