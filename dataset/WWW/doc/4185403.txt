Similarity spreading : a unified framework for similarity calculation of interrelated objects In many Web search applications , similarities between objects of one type ( say , queries ) can be affected by the similarities between their interrelated objects of another type ( say , Web pages ) , and vice versa . We propose a novel framework called similarity spreading to take account of the interrelationship and improve the similarity calculation . Experiment results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the accuracy of the similarity measurement of the objects in a search engine .
