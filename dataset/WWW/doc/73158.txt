An automatic semantic relationships discovery approach An important obstacle to the success of the Semantic Web is that the establishment of the semantic relationship is labor-intensive . This paper proposes an automatic semantic relationship discovering approach for constructing the semantic link network . The basic premise of this work is that the semantics of a web page can be reflected by a set of keywords , and the semantic relationship between two web pages can be determined by the semantic relationship between their keyword sets . The approach adopts the data mining algorithms to discover the semantic relationships between keyword sets , and then uses deductive and analogical reasoning to enrich the semantic relationships . The proposed algorithms have been implemented . Experiment shows that the approach is feasible .
