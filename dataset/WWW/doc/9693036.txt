A measurement-driven analysis of information propagation in the flickr social network Online social networking sites like MySpace , Facebook , and Flickr have become a popular way to share and disseminate content . Their massive popularity has led to viral marketing techniques that attempt to spread content , products , and ideas on these sites . However , there is little data publicly available on viral propagation in the real world and few studies have characterized how information spreads over current online social networks . In this paper , we collect and analyze large-scale traces of information dissemination in the Flickr social network . Our analysis , based on crawls of the favorite markings of 2.5 million users on 11 million photos , aims at answering three key questions : ( a ) how widely does information propagate in the social network ? ( b ) how quickly does information propagate ? and ( c ) what is the role of word-of-mouth exchanges between friends in the overall propagation of information in the network ? Contrary to viral marketing `` intuition , '' we find that ( a ) even popular photos do not spread widely throughout the network , ( b ) even popular photos spread slowly through the network , and ( c ) information exchanged between friends is likely to account for over 50 of all favorite-markings , but with a significant delay at each hop .
